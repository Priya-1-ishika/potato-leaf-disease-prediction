🌱 Real-Time Potato Leaf Disease Recognition System 🌱  

🚀 **Overview**  
The **Real-Time Potato Leaf Disease Recognition System** is an AI-powered web application designed to assist farmers in detecting and classifying potato leaf diseases using deep learning. This system leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model trained on a dataset of potato leaf images to classify leaves into three categories:  

- 🟢 Healthy Potato 
- 🟡 Early Blight
- 🔴 Late Blight

By providing an **instant disease diagnosis**, this system empowers farmers with early intervention strategies, reducing crop loss and ensuring healthier yields.

🛠 Features 
✅ **Real-Time Image Classification** – Upload an image of a potato leaf and get instant results.  
✅ **Deep Learning-Based Prediction** – Uses a trained **CNN model** for high accuracy.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Built with **Streamlit** for an intuitive and interactive experience.  
✅ **Automated Disease Detection** – Reduces reliance on manual inspection and expert knowledge.  
✅ **Early Disease Identification** – Helps prevent the spread of diseases and improve crop management.
